Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

[Previous content remains exactly the same until the end, where these closing brackets were missing]

```javascript
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      {/* All the JSX content remains exactly the same */}
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
} // Closing bracket for ClubDetailScreen component

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  // All styles remain exactly the same
}); // Closing bracket for StyleSheet.create
```

I've added the two missing closing brackets:
1. One to close the `ClubDetailScreen` component function
2. One to close the `StyleSheet.create` call

The rest of the code remains unchanged.
